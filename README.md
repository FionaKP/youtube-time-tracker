 Custom Chrome Extension with running timer of youtube watchtime

## Purpose
I love learning. I like to read articles, listen to podcasts, and watch videos to learn about new cool topics and hear the thoughts of people I admire and look up to. The problem with Youtube is that all of this good educational content is mixed in with some really great captivating and entertaining videos. Sometimes I can get carried away and the purpose of this chrome extension is to help me realize how much time I am spending on youtube.

### Potential Future Additions

* Make time comparisons (2 ATWTMVs, 1 half of a soccer game, etc)
* Use AI to tell you if the video fits into your inputted priorities
* Randomly timed popups asking if you would like to keep watching (like netflix)
